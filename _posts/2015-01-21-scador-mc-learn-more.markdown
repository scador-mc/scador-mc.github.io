## WHAT IS IT
Imagine a company selling complex products going through a custom assembly process before the order completes. They can decide to make a few variants of their product and mass produce it or they can hire an expert who will work with the customer in order to select components based on technical and business constraints. The first option causes loss of market share and stocking of excess inventory, the second requires highly paid labor from a subject matter expert.

ScadorMC consolidates expert knowledge in the form of an easy to use self service program and integrates with pricing and quote programs; additionally customer configurations can be sent straight to a manufacturing line.

## WHAT IT SOLVES
It makes the process of setting up a configuration knowledge base effortless - both in the case where rules are simple and to a large extent when they are complex.The product provides cheap and speedy product customization up front and ensures configurations are always valid on the back end in a manufacturing environment, where errors are costly.

## WHO IS THE CUSTOMER
Currently this type of product is in use mainly by large and some medium enterprises. We are aiming to expand the market all the way to small businesses. Our product can be used in a scaled-down version with a few basic constraints and as a multi-level setup with thousands of business rules per product. We have multiple scaling strategies.

The technology serves providers of Assemble-To-Order products in the broadest sense: It could be a traditional hardware manufacturer like a car manufacturer or a service provider like an insurance or telecommunications company.
