## Background
Honestly hardware product configuration was primary reason Scador MC was written. There are two major groups of products being made and sold at the moment Pick To Order (PTO) where you are having some instance of product you can not modify you can just pick one or another. You can visualise PTO as not so apealing sandwich hermetically closed in the box or foil wrap you can often find on the gas staion shop or supermarket. You basically need to make some compromise to chose one. There is another group of products called Assemble To Order (ATO) where you can customise your product within some bonduaries. In this case its easy to visualise it as a gourmet sandwich bar where you can pick bread and various toppings.You can make something closer to you needs and if you are dealing with chef having good taste he will probably prevent you from doing risky things like putting cabbage on nutella spread and loading it with horseaddish mustard ;)
Most of car manufactures give you access to hardware configurator and Scador MC is totally capable of doing it lets make simpler case in order to demonstrate that it can be used in scaled down environment.
